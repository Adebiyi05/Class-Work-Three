Inhalers and Injections
For respiratory issues, inhalers deliver medication straight to the lungs, helping residents breathe easier. For instance, someone with asthma might use a salbutamol inhaler during flare-ups. Injections, on the other hand, are used when medication needs to be delivered directly into the body. A resident with diabetes might rely on daily insulin injections to keep their blood sugar levels under control.

Suppositories and Pessaries
Sometimes, medications are delivered through the rectal or vaginal route using suppositories or pessaries. These methods are often chosen when oral medications arenâ€™t an option or for specific local treatments. For example, while one resident may use an inhaler for asthma, another might need regular insulin injections to manage their diabetes, highlighting the diverse ways medications are tailored to individual needs.
