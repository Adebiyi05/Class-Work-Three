Oral Medications
Oral medications, like pills, tablets, or syrups, are one of the most common ways to take medicine. Theyâ€™re easy to use and effective for a range of conditions. For example, a simple paracetamol tablet can help relieve pain or reduce a fever, making it a convenient choice for many residents.

Topical Treatments
Topical medications are applied directly to the skin to treat localized issues. Creams, ointments, or lotions are commonly used for skin conditions. A good example is hydrocortisone cream, which can soothe eczema and reduce inflammation, offering quick relief for irritated skin.
