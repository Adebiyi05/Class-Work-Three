In my organization, medications are tailored to meet the specific health needs of residents. For pain management, paracetamol is often used for mild discomfort, while ibuprofen may address inflammation-related pain.
 For those with conditions like schizophrenia, antipsychotics such as risperidone or olanzapine can help manage symptoms, promoting better interaction and participation in daily activities.
Chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and heart conditions, are also prevalent in these settings. Residents with diabetes might use metformin for blood sugar control, and some may require insulin injections to manage their condition effectively. 
For example, a resident having agitation may have lorazepam , while another with persistent back pain may use paracetamol to stay comfortable.
